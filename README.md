## Introduction
Next.js (pronounced /ˈnɛkst dʒeɪ/) is a progressive framework for building web applications. It is designed from the ground up to be incrementally adoptable, and can seamlessly transition between a lightweight library and a robust framework based on diverse use cases. Next.js comprises a versatile core library that emphasizes the view layer, along with a thriving ecosystem of auxiliary libraries, empowering you to manage intricacies in expansive Single-Page Applications.
